# This is my last project in college

> I created a Blockchain prototype to show its use for tracking software contracts, where Blockchain has full knowledge of contracts on the network, creates a hash for new contracts added on the network, creates new hash for all changes that occur in the contract, thus allowing it to have traceability within the network, due to hardware problems it was not possible to put the Blockchain online, to circumvent this situation I used a database to represent the use of the Blockchain.

# For this project i used

> Debian 11 OS, ganache-cli, truffle, JavaScript and solidity.
